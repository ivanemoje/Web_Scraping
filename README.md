# Web_Scraping
This project encompasses use of beautifulsoup, reportlab and csv. 
The goal of the project is to scrape data from the website 4icu.org, obtain all the Universities in Africa and store this data into mySQL. 

Thereafter, the stored data is queried and stored in a desirable file format such as csv and PDF.
